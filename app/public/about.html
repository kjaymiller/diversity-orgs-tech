        <h2>Who made this?</h2>
        <h3>Hi I'm <a href="https://kjaymiller.com/about">Jay!</a></h3>
        <h2>Why did you make this?</h2>
        <p>Two reasons</p>
        <p>There was technology that I wanted to explore and talk about.</p>
        <h3>But more importantly</h3>
        <p>I am always looking for organizations and meetups that aim to help folks from underrepresented groups learn and be exposed to more folks like them in the tech industry. I wanted to create a free resource for people to find groups where they feel welcomed and encouraged to be themselves.</p>

        <h2>You said "Free". Are you collecting information and selling it.</h2>

        <h3>No</h3>

        <p>In terms of data I don't collect any personal data. The searches that people make are collected. This is mostly to see what areas groups and locations people are searching for that we don't have any information on.</p>
        <h3>No IP or any location or personal data is collected when you search.</h3> 
        <p>I only see a timestamp and the content that was searched.</p>

        <h2>What about the contact form</h2>

        <p>I do ask for an email address if you reach out to me regarding adding/updating an entry. I do this for two reasons. One, this helps the contact form prevent spam. Two, so I can email you to let you know that we've made updates according to your feedback.</p>

        <p>I use <a href="https://formspree.io">For our contact form</a>. If you don't want to contact me via the form, you can message me on <a href="https://twitter.com/kjaymiller">twitter</a>.</p>

        <h2>How are you keeping this running?</h2>

        <p>This project isn't a money-making venture and the upkeep and costs are out of my pocket.</p>

        <p>I'm able to keep my costs low by making the development <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/diversity-orgs-tech">open-source</a> and using <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/kjaymiller">donations</a> to cover any regular costs.</p>
